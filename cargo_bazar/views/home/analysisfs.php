			<p>An airfreight Bid explains the price structure for a freight shipment, the cargo route, the delivery times and the terms and conditions to be considered while using air freight services. An ideal airfreight Bid assists businesses to analyse the landed cost of their cargo, estimate delivery time, handover date, container packing schedule and associated in-transit deadlines and risks. If you are not in a yearly contract with your air freight forwarder or beginning to trade with a new business partner makes it essential to check the airfreight Bid for each individual transaction. Checking an airfreight Bid requires expertise and experience, as a small missed out point or assumption can delay the cargo and significantly increase your airfreight costs. Established freight forwarding providers provide individualised, complete and error free airfreight Bids each time, as airfreight requirements can vary by customer for each shipment. Therefore, to meet shipping targets, it is essential for Freight, Logistics and Supply Chain Managers to act proactively and understand all the essential points of an airfreight Bid before shipping the goods. This reduces the risk of mistakes and assists them to meet their targets by using error-free airfreight services.

			<h2>Cargo routing may cause delays and additional cost</h2>
			<p>A complete airfreight Bid states the cargo routing. Cargo routing plays an important role in determining the landed cost and the transit time. Air flights with multiple stopovers take more time and may incur extra freight forwarding costs in comparison with direct flights. It is not always this way so best to double check. Not having knowledge about the route of your air freight shipment creates an information gap as well as a lack of clarity about transit time and landed cost. Proactive managers check the cargo routing and this assists them to meet the targeted transit time and landed cost.
</p>		
			<h2>Completeness of airfreight charges</h2>
			<p>Freight charges make up a large part of a landed cost, and the landed cost assists to determine the sale price of a product.to calculate the accurate landed cost of a shipment it is essential that the airfreight Bid include all the anticipated charges. To make air freight Bids competitive and to try and win new freight forwarding business, many unprofessional freight forwarding service providers provide only half of the anticipate charges or an incomplete list of charges. This type of freight forwarder prefer to keep ambiguity in their air freight Bids and prefers to keep their customers uninformed. Smart freight forwarding managers check the completeness of an airfreight Bid and confirm the landed cost before shipping any shipment.
</p>
			<h2>Frequency of airline to meet delivery deadlines</h2>
			<p>Airfreight is the fastest shipping mode and leaves a very small window for production, export clearance and container packing. All operations should align in a way to meet delivery deadlines. However, governments and airlines have very strict policies and restrictions for safety and security. These norms and changes increase the risk of a last minute cancellation and can delay the cargo for hours or even days. To manage these delays and meet deadlines, air freight cargo should be connected to the next available flight. An air freight Bid should include the frequency of the flight so that shipments can be packed and delivered to the airport without disturbing the pre-determined shipping schedule and cost structure.
</p>
			<h2>Validity of an airfreight Bid</h2>
			<p>Airfreight rates are very volatile and impacted by the crude oil price, seasonality, port congestion and government policies and in line with this, air freight Bids will have a limited validity. Businesses usually gather and finalize the airfreight Bid days before sending the cargo. If your air freight shipment runs a few days late, you may find you Bid has expired. Smart business managers understand this and plan ahead by confirming their airfreight Bid with their freight forwarding company a week prior to their shipping schedule. This saves them from last minute worry and can assist them to achieve their targeted landed cost.
</p>
			<h2>Terms and conditions</h2>
			<p>Cost and transit time are two parameters used to check the competitiveness of an airfreight Bid. It is a wise decision to check terms and conditions as well. Terms and conditions include payment terms, packing requirements, cut-off times, legal aspects and other important information. Not checking the terms and conditions section properly can lead to unexpected charges, instant payments or delay the cargo. To choose the best airfreight service provider for your shipment, it is essential to check the terms and conditions section carefully.
</p>
			<h2>IATA accreditation</h2>
			<p>IATA, which stands for the International Air Transport Association, is trade association that represents airlines. IATA also accredits Cargo Agents. Only accredited IATA cargo agents can book air freight cargo space directly with airlines. If you work with a non-accredited freight forwarder, they will book with a wholesaler, which means that one more company will mark up cost for your air freight shipment. This is easily overcome by working exclusively with IATA accredited cargo agent.
