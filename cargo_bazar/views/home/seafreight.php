			The global shipping industry transports over 90 percent of the world's total commerce, according to the International Shipping Federation (ISF).

         <p>Sea freight is the best option for movement of massive weights. It is cost effective in comparison to air freight.
</p>
		<p>Worldwide, over 30,000 large, privately owned vessels transport merchandise across oceans.  Vessels include dry bulk carriers, which transport commodities such as iron ore, coal, and food; liquid bulk carriers such as tankers that ship crude oil, chemicals, and petroleum products; diesel-powered container ships; general cargo ships; and roll on roll off (RORO) vessels that transport wheeled cargo such as cars, trucks, and trains. Service takes three different forms: liner, charter, and tanker service. Liner service is regular, scheduled stops at ports along a fixed route. Liner routes are dominated by container ships transporting manufactured goods.

		<p>A ship's capacity is measured by several formulas. Dead weight tonnage (DWT) is the total weight of cargo, supplies, and crew that can be loaded on an "empty" ship. Gross register tonnage (GRT) measures the total internal capacity of a vessel. One GRT is equal to a volume of 100 cubic feet. The average tanker is between 250,000 and 350,000 DWT; dry bulk carriers average 100,000 to 150,000. Twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) refer to a container ship's total cargo-carrying capacity. The average container ship has a capacity of around 5,000 TEUs and can carry around 3,000 40-foot containers. A ship's capacity is measured by several formulas.

		<p>Ships depend highly on complex information systems to maintain vessel schedules and efficiently manage terminal operations. Deep sea shippers manage ship routing through real-time, web-based tracking systems. Some shippers outsource route optimization to technology companies that track weather and wind patterns. Radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging allows customers to track containers and cargo throughout the entire voyage. A mandatory international safety protocol, the Global Maritime Distress & Safety System (GMDSS), replaces Morse Code by automating distress signalling and locating.</p>
